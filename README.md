# Housing Prices Prediction using Linear Regression

This project demonstrates a simple implementation of a **linear regression model** to predict housing prices based on the size of the house. It uses **Python**, **NumPy**, and **Matplotlib** for computations and visualizations.

---

## Project Overview

- **Visualize Data**: Scatter plot of actual housing data.
- **Predict Prices**: Enter house size to predict the price.
- **Experiment**: Adjust model parameters (weight `w` and bias `b`) to see changes in predictions.

---

## Features

1. **Data Visualization**:
   - Red `x` marks represent actual data points (size vs. price).
   - Blue line represents the predicted regression line.

2. **Interactive Input**:
   - Predict the price for a user-provided house size.

3. **Customizable Model**:
   - Modify the `w` (weight) and `b` (bias) values to experiment with different model predictions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed with the following dependencies:
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`

You can install the required packages using:

pip install numpy matplotlib
## Running the Program

### Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/your-username/housing-prices-prediction.git

cd housing-prices-prediction

### Run the file
